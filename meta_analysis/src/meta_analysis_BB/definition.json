    "long_description": "This building block is designed to analyse the set of simulations generated for each individual in order to assess whether any of the parameters of interest show a differential distribution between the phenotypic subgroups included in a sample. To do so, the building block processes the output generated by the patient-personalized PhysiBoSS runs, including for each individual a given number of replicates of both wild-type and mutant experiments. With this information, the building block can be used to assess the degree of uncertainty for each parameter and determine whether there are significant differences between the different subgroups, described both graphically and numerically.",
