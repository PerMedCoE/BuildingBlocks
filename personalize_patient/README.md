## Description

This building block tailors a given MaBoSS Boolean model to a given RNAseq dataset of interest.
This RNAseq dataset can come from the "Single cell processing" buildig block  needs to be normalised as described in ["BÃ©al, J. et al. (2019) Personalization of logical models with multi-omics data allows clinical stratification of patients. Front. Physiol., 9, 1965."](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2018.01965/full?field=&journalName=Frontiers_in_Physiology&id=369984) and in the [PROFILE's GitHub repository](https://github.com/sysbio-curie/PROFILE).

Future uses of this building block may include other data sources such as mutations, Copy Number Alterations and proteomics counts.

## User instructions

### Requirements

- Python >= 3.6
- [Singularity](https://singularity.lbl.gov/docs-installation)
- `permedcoe` base package: `python3 -m pip install permedcoe`

In addtion to the dependencies, it is necessary to generate the associated
singularity image ([`PhysiCell-COVID19.singularity`](../Resources/images/PhysiCell-COVID19.singularity))
and the building block asset folder ([`personalize_patient`](../Resources/assets/personalize_patient)),
located in the **Resources** folder of this repository.

They **MUST be available and exported in the following environment variables**
before its usage:

```bash
export PERMEDCOE_IMAGES="/path/to/images/"
export PERMEDCOE_ASSETS="/path/to/assets/"
```

### Installation

This package provides an automatic installation script:

```bash
./install.sh
```

This script creates a file `installation_files.txt` to keep track of the
installed files.
It is used with the `uninstall.sh` script to uninstall the Building Block
from the system.

### Usage

The `personalize_patient` package provides a clear interface that allows
it to be used with multiple workflow managers (e.g. PyCOMPSs, NextFlow and
Snakemake).

It can be imported from python and invoked directly from a **PyCOMPSs**
application, or through the command line for other workflow managers
(e.g. Snakemake and NextFlow).

The command line is:

```bash
personalize_patient_BB -d \
      -i <normalized_data> <cells_metadata> <model_prefix> <t> <ko_file> \
      -o <model_ouput_dir> <personalized_result> \
      --mount_points ${COVID19_BB_ASSETS}/personalize_patient/:${COVID19_BB_ASSETS}/personalize_patient/
```

Where the parameters are:

|        | Parameter              | File      | Description                                                                      |
|--------|------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Input  | \<normalized_data>     | File      | tsv of the normalized RNAseq data                                                |
| Input  | \<cells_metadata>      | File      | tsv of the different patients to be analyzed with their clinical information     |
| Input  | \<model_prefix>        | String    | Prefix that describes the model                                                  |
| Input  | \<t>                   | String    | [TO BE COMPLETED]                                                                |
| Input  | \<ko_file>             | File      | File result of the "High-throughput mutant analysis" (aka MaBoSS) building block |
| Output | \<result_folder>       | Directory | Folder where the results will be located                                         |
| Output | \<personalized_result> | Directory | [TO BE COMPLETED]                                                                |

Alternatively, it can be used to perform patient personalize cellline:

The command line is:

```bash
personalize_patient_BB -d \
      -i <expression> <cnv> <mutation> <cell_type> <model_bnd> <model_cfg> \
      -o <model_ouput_dir> \
      -c <config_file> \
      --mount_points ${COVID19_BB_ASSETS}/personalize_patient/:${COVID19_BB_ASSETS}/personalize_patient/
```

Where the parameters are:

|        | Parameter              | File      | Description                                                                      |
