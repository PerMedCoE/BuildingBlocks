## List of Building Blocks

1. [**Build Model From Species**](build_model_from_species/)

    [One line description]

2. [**MaBoSS**](MaBoSS/)

    This building block uses MaBoSS to screen all the possible knock outs of a given Boolean model.

3. [**Meta Analysis**](meta_analysis/)

    This building block performs a meta-analysis to determine which parameters of interest in PhysiBoSS are distributed differently among the patient subgroups.

4. [**Personalize Patient**](personalize_patient/)

    This building block tailors a given MaBoSS Boolean model to a given RNAseq dataset of interest, for instance from the "Single-cell Processing" building block.


5. [**PhysiBoSS**](PhysiBoSS/)

    This building block performs a multiscale simulation of a population of cells using PhysiBoSS.

6. [**Print Drug Results**](print_drug_results/)

    [One line description]

7. [**Single-cell Processing**](single_cell_processing/)

    This building block performs the processing and analysis of the single-cell RNA-Seq data from the patients included in the sample.
