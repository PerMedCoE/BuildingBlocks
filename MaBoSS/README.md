## Description

This building block uses MaBoSS to screen all the possible knock outs of a given Boolean model.
More information in MaBoSS can be found in the work [Stoll, G. et al. (2017) MaBoSS 2.0: an environment for stochastic Boolean modeling. Bioinformatics, 33, 2226â€“2228.](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx123) and in the dedicated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/maboss-bkmc/MaBoSS-env-2.0).

## User instructions

### Requirements

- Python >= 3.6
- [Singularity](https://singularity.lbl.gov/docs-installation)
- `permedcoe` base package: `python3 -m pip install permedcoe`

In addtion to the dependencies, it is necessary to generate the associated
singularity images ([`MaBoSS.singularity`](../Resources/images/MaBoSS.singularity) and [MaBoSS_sensitivity.singularity](../Resources/images/MaBoSS_sensitivity.singularity))
and the building block asset folder ([`MaBoSS`](../Resources/assets/MaBoSS)),
located in the **Resources** folder of this repository.

They **MUST be available and exported respectively in the following environment variables**
before its usage:

```bash
export PERMEDCOE_IMAGES="/path/to/images/"
export PERMEDCOE_ASSETS="/path/to/assets/"
```

### Installation

This package provides an automatic installation script:

```bash
./install.sh
```

This script creates a file `installation_files.txt` to keep track of the
installed files.
It is used with the `uninstall.sh` script to uninstall the Building Block
from the system.

### Usage

The `MaBoSS` package provides a clear interface that allows
it to be used with multiple workflow managers (e.g. PyCOMPSs, NextFlow and
Snakemake).

It can be imported from python and invoked directly from a **PyCOMPSs**
application, or through the command line for other workflow managers
(e.g. Snakemake and NextFlow).

The command line is:

```bash
maboss_BB -d \
    -i <prefix> <data_folder> \
    -o <ko_file> \
    --mount_point ${PERMEDCOE_ASSETS}/MaBoSS:${PERMEDCOE_ASSETS}/MaBoSS
```

Where the parameters are:

|        | Parameter          | Type      | Description                                             |
|--------|--------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Input  | \<prefix>          | String    | name of the model                                       |
| Input  | \<data_folder>     | Directory | fodler where the model files are located |
| Output | \<ko_file>         | File      | name of the output file with the knock-out candidates |

### Uninstall

Uninstall can be achieved by executing the following scripts:

```bash
./uninstall.sh
./clean.sh
```
